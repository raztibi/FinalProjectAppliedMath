The repository holds the following code:
1. leslieNoHunt.py - The first Simulation, can compare different psi functions without hunting rates
2. leslieWithHunt.py - The second Simulation, can compare different psi functions with hunting rates
3. maximizeTotalHunt.py - The third Simulation, will generate the maximum yield of hunting for given beta, fertilty and survival rates.
4. plotHforSomeK.py - The forth Simulation, will plot the yield function by hunt rate, for given beta, fertilty and survival rates, and given k (age) to start the hunting with.
